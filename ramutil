sourcetype="your_sourcetype" host="your_hostname" "RAM utilization" | eval utilization=substr(value, 0, index(value, "%")) | timechart avg(utilization) as utilization by host

This query uses the sourcetype and host parameters to specify the source type and hostname for the logs you want to search. The "RAM utilization" keyword is used to filter for logs that contain the text "RAM utilization".

The eval command is used to extract the utilization value from the log message, by using the substr and index functions to extract the characters from the beginning of the string to the percent symbol.
